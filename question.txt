// Any queries regarding the problem or submission should be directed to hr@iamdave.ai
// Solution can be submitted using: a text file with proper extension depending on the language with proper indentation. If you are writing psuedo-code, then a .txt file with proper indentation is to be submitted.
// Write a program in Javascript (or any other programming language of your choice, or even pseudocode)

// Write a function called do_allocation(number_of_people, number_of_buses)
// The function should return a list of number of people who can get into the next bus that comes in based on the following logic:
// Each bus’s capacity is the sum of the capacities of the previous two buses.
// Once all the people get in, then the buses can continue, but will have 0 people inside it.
// This is the case when the number of people are less and there are more buses. So after all the people are already boarded, then the remaining buses will have 0 people boarding.
// The output of the function is an array/list with the same length as number_of_buses.
// The total of this output array/list should be less than or equal to the number_of_people.
// The first bus’ capacity can be set to 1 by default.

// E.g.

// Def  do_allocation(number_of_people, number_of_buses):
//       …. Your code….
//      Return array[number of people got into first bus, number of people got into second bus, …. , number of people who got into last bus]

// Please submit the solution with properly written code with comments so that the reader can understand the logic.
